# Astral Core: Project Status & Next Steps

This document outlines the current state of the Astral Core application and the remaining tasks for a production launch.

## âœ… Completed Milestones

The application has been fully architected as a full-stack, client-server application powered by a suite of secure, mock backend services running on Netlify Functions.

-   **Full-Stack Architecture:** The entire frontend is decoupled from the data layer and communicates exclusively with a backend API.
-   **Complete Feature Set:** All user-facing features (peer support, AI chat, helper dashboards, wellness tracking, etc.) are functionally complete against the mock backend.
-   **Secure API Gateway:** A secure backend function (`/api/ai`) has been implemented to protect the Gemini API key. All other functions are secured with mock JWT authentication.
-   **Centralized State Management:** All application state is managed by a robust and performant Zustand implementation, ensuring predictable and maintainable state transitions.
-   **Production-Ready UI:** The UI is built with a scalable component architecture, is fully responsive, and supports light/dark modes.
-   **Database-Ready Backend:** The mock backend functions are architected with a centralized data access layer (`lib/database.ts`), making the transition to a real database straightforward.

## ðŸš€ Next Steps for Production Launch

The foundational work is complete. The following tasks are required to move from the current, fully-functional prototype to a live, scalable production environment.

-   **Connect to a Production Database:**
    -   **Task:** Replace the mock database layer (`netlify/functions/lib/database.ts`) with a connection to a live, persistent database like PostgreSQL (e.g., via Neon, Supabase, or PlanetScale).
    -   **Details:** This involves setting up the database service, defining the final schema, and swapping the mock data functions for real SQL queries using a client like Prisma or Kysely.

-   **Implement Real-Time Chat Service:**
    -   **Task:** Upgrade the chat functionality from HTTP polling to a true real-time service using WebSockets.
    -   **Details:** The recommended approach is to integrate a managed service like Ably or Pusher. The backend's role would be to securely generate authentication tokens for clients to connect to that service.

-   **Set Up Database Migrations & Schema:**
    -   **Task:** Establish a formal system for managing database schema changes.
    -   **Details:** Use a migration tool like `db-migrate` or Prisma Migrate to ensure safe, repeatable, and version-controlled updates to the production database structure as the application evolves.

-   **CI/CD Pipeline & Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**
    -   **Task:** Implement a full CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
    -   **Details:** For a professional production environment, use GitHub Actions or a similar service to run tests on every push and automatically deploy the frontend and serverless functions to Netlify. Consider using Terraform for managing any additional cloud infrastructure.

-   **HIPAA Compliance (Backend):**
    -   **Task:** Implement all necessary backend technical safeguards for full HIPAA compliance.
    -   **Details:** This includes ensuring encryption at rest for all sensitive data in the production database, detailed audit logging, and strict access controls. This is a complex legal and technical requirement that needs careful planning.
